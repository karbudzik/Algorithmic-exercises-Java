# Team reshuffle
## Exercise description
Write an algorithm that creates new teams from a set of people with one constraint: no one can have earlier teammates in their new teams. The previous team setup is given in a text file and the reshuffling algorithm has to be based on that and check the constraints from there.

What you need is a method that given the old teams returns new teams where the above condition holds.

It doesn't have to be randomized. A deterministic solution is fine too.
One reshuffle is enough. It doesn't have to take into account older iterations.
## Execution
The method written reshuffles the team members (with the constant number of members in groups).
The basic tests were created, too.

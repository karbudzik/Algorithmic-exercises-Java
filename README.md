# Algorithmic-exercises-Java
Set of smaller assignments aiming at improving algorithmic skills. Each exercise is held in different package, described separately and tested.
## Table of all exercises:
* **Minesweeper** - generating board, adding mines to it and calculating the points value for remaining fields.
